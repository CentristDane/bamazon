# Bamazon
I built a Bamazon Customer and Bamazon Manager app that will simulate the expereince of being either a manager or customer at a Bamazon store for the user 

## Bamazon Customer

App starts by asking customer what item they would like to purchase and lists all items available:

![prompt](/images/prompt.png)

If the user selects an item and a quantity that is in stock the app will congratulate them on the purchase and display the total cost:

![purchase](/images/purchase.png)

if the user choses an unavailable quantity it lets them know they are out of luck:

![out](/images/out.png)

## Bamazon Manager

This app simulates a manager updatinging/monitoring inventor from backend. 

Starts with user viewing options

![manager prompt](/images/manager_prompt.png)

User can choose to view inventory:

![view](/images/view.png)

User can choose to see all of the inventory that is runnin low (less than 5 in stock):

![low](/images/low.png)

User can add to inventory stock

![add](/images/add.png)

And finally, user can add entirely new item:  

![add](/images/add-product.png)

and here is proof that all the functions work:
