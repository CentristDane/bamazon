# Bamazon
I built a Bamazon Customer and Bamazon Manager app that will simulate the expereince of being either a manager or customer at a Bamazon store for the user 

## Bamazon Customer

App starts by asking customer what item they would like to purchase and lists all items available:
![prompt](/images/prompt.png)

If the user selects an item and a quantity that is in stock the app will congratulate them on the purchase and display the total cost:
![purchase](/images/purchase.png)

if the user choses an unavailable quantity it lets them know they are out of luck:
![out](/images/out.png)
